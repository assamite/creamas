Creamas - Creative Multi-Agent Systems
======================================================

.. image:: _static/python-powered-w-70x28.png

Creamas is Python (3.5+) library for (creative) multi-agent systems. It was
created as a tool to research and implement multi-agent systems that exhibit
emergent and/or creative behavior in some ways. However, its main
implementations are general enough to be used for multi-agent systems with
other purposes. See :doc:`overview` for a short introduction to the library's
main components.

Project's main repository is in `github <https://github.com/assamite/creamas>`_.
