'''
.. py:module:: environment

This module holds ``Enviroment``-class, an universe where the agents live.
Environment holds methods for inter-agent communication and some utilities that
are usually needed when implementing creative multi-agent systems.

All implementations should subclass ``Environment`` in order to provide basic
functionality for the system to operate.

Environments are used by defining their address at the instantation time, and
adding agents to their container.
