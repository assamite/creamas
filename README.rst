Creamas is a library designed to help creating multi-agent systems in the field
of computational creativity. However, the requirements for the multi-agent
systems (and agents especially) are not strict, and therefore the library can
be used to build any types of agent-based systems. If you are looking for a
minimalistic MAS-library, check out `aiomas
<https://aiomas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. Creamas is build on top of it.

.. attention::

	Creamas is developed with Python 3.5, and will not work on earlier Python
	versions; not now or in the future.
