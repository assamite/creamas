Creamas is a library for developing creative multi-agent systems. However, the requirements for the agents
are not strict, and therefore the library can be used to build any types of agent-based systems. If you are looking for
a minimalistic MAS-library, check out `aiomas <https://aiomas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. Creamas is built on top of it.
